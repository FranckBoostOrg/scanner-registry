# Boostsecurity Scanner Module Guide
Guide for the Boostsecurity Scanner Module creators that want to integrate security scanners to the Boostsecurity platform. Modules are the way to integrate the scanner output to the Boostsecurity platform. The Boostsecurity CLI will use the Module configuration to execute the scanner, parse the results and send those to the platform.

## Architecture Overview

![architecture](schemas/scanner_architecture.png)

 1. The Boostsecurity CLI launches the scanner (as defined in module yaml).
 2. The Boostsecurity CLI runs the converter on the scanner output (as defined by the post-processing in module yaml). The sarif output from the converter needs to be compliant with Boostsecurityâ€™s taxonomies.
 3. The Boostsecurity CLI creates the scanner context (org, repo, branch info, etc..), computes the fingerprint on sarif results and uploads the scan results to the Boostsecurity backend.

## Module Definition
The module.yaml file defines the module behavior and its configuration. The file is located in the root of the module directory and defines how to deal with the various phases:
    
  1. [Scanning Setup](#scanning-setup)
  2. [Scanning](#scan-with-container-image)
  3. [Post-Scanning](#scan-post-processing)

### Module Header
```yaml
api_version: 1.0 # Boostsecurity CLI Module API Version

id: <id> # Unique ID of the module
name: <name> # Display Name of the module
namespace: <namespace> # Namespace of the module rules
```
Namespace is used to group module rules. Rules can be shared across multiple modules if they are in the same namespace.

### Differential and Full Scanning
The Boostsecurity CLI can run modules in two different modes: differential and main scanning. The differential scanning mode is used to scan only the files that have changed between two commits. This is usually used in the context of Pull Requests to only scan the changes introduced. The full(or main) scanning mode is used to scan the whole codebase.

```yaml
config:
  support_diff_scan: true # true if the module supports differential scanning
```

### Scanning Formats
The Boostsecurity CLI can ingest the scanner output in different formats: Sarif and CycloneDX. The module.yaml file defines the supported format of a Module.

The CycloneDX format is used for SBOM modules and Sarif is for asset security scanning.

```yaml
steps:
- scan:
    command:
      ...
    format: sarif # sarif or cyclonedx
```


#### Sarif
The Sarif output format is a JSON based format that is used by many security scanners. Sarif is the expected format for security scan results. The Boostsecurity CLI will parse the Sarif output and send the results to the Boostsecurity platform.

The Boostsecurity platform provides extensions to the Sarif format, known as [Taxonomies](schemas/sarif-schema.json), which are used to provide additional metadata about findings issued by various scanners.

The following types of findings are supported by the platform:

 * Static application security testing(SAST) Scan Result
    
   [SAST Scan Result JSON Schema](schemas/sast-schema.json)
 * Software Composition Analysis(SCA) Result
    
   [SCA Scan Result JSON Schema](schemas/sca-schema.json)
 * Container Scan Result
    
   Similar to an SCA type but with extra metadata about the container image.
  
   [Container Scan Result JSON Schema](schemas/container-schema.json)



#### CycloneDX
The CycloneDX is a Software Bill of Materials(SBOM) format used to inventory the software components used in a project. The Boostsecurity CLI will parse the CycloneDX output and send the results to the platform. Results will be visible in the SBOM section.

### Scanning

#### Scanning Setup
The optional setup section may be used to download or prepare utilities that would be used by this module. These steps will be executed only once before the scans occur.

In subsequent steps, any files made available in this temporary directory may be referenced via the `$SETUP_PATH` variable.

```yaml
setup:
  - name: Install post-processing dependency
    run: |
      curl -fsSL -O "https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases/download/jq-1.6/jq-linux64"
      echo "af986793a515d500ab2d35f8d2aecd656e764504b789b66d7e1a0b727a124c44  jq-linux64" | sha256sum --check
      chmod +x jq-linux64
```

#### Scan with Container Image
The container image is pulled and run inside the CI environment to execute the scan.
```yaml
steps:
- scan:
    command:
      docker:
        image: <image>
        command: <container command> # optional
        entrypoint: <container entrypoint> # optional
        workdir: <container workdir> # optional the git repo will be mounted to this directory
        environment:
          ENVVARIABLE: <value>
    format: ...
```


#### Scan with Executable
The executable is run inside the CI environment to execute the scan. Requires that the executable has been installed in the setup step.
```yaml
steps:
- scan:
    command:
      environment:
        ENVVARIABLE: <value>
      run: |
        $SETUP_PATH/<executable>
    format: ...
```

#### Scan Post-Processing
The post-processing step is used to process the scanner output before sending it to the Boostsecurity platform. It is executed after the scan step and is optional.

##### Post-Processing using a Container Image
```yaml
steps:
- scan:
    command:
      ...
    format: ...
    post-processor:
      docker:
        image: <image>
        command: <container command>
        environment:
          ENVVARIABLE: <value>
```
##### Post-Processing using an Executable
Requires the executable to have been installed in the setup step.
```yaml
steps:
- scan:
    command:
      ...
    format: ...
    post-processor:
      run: $SETUP_PATH/<executable>
```

## Module Rules
Module rules are used to enrich the findings to ensure the policy processing per proper group or categories as well as the proper display of the description in the Boostsecurity platform. 

The rules are defined in the rules.yaml file. The file is located in the root of the module directory.

```yaml
rules:
  G111: # Unique ID of the rule
    categories: # Categories/Labels of the rule. The available options are defined in the Boostsecurity platform.
    - ALL
    - cwe-22
    - boost-baseline
    - boost-hardened
    - cwe-top-25
    - owasp-top-10
    group: top10-broken-access-control # Group of the rule. Used for display and aggregation in the Boostsecurity platform. The available groups are defined in the platform.
    name: G111 # Unique ID of the rule
    pretty_name: 'G111: Potential directory traversal' # Display name of the rule
    description: <description>
    ref: <ref> # Reference URL of the rule
```
### Leveraging rules from other rules namespace
When defining the rules for a scanner module, it is sometimes desirable to reuse rules in some other modules. For example if the scanner module creates findings with the same rule id as for another exisitng scanner module, or a curated rules database.
To reuse an existing rules database, import the rules files with the following syntax:
```yaml
import:
  - boostsecurityio/semgrep
  - <other realm>/<curated rules>
```
Multiple rules definition files can be imported. Note that the order of precedence is from bottom to top of the list. Which means if rules with the same rule id are defined in multiple of the imported rules file, the last loaded rule is the one that has precedence. That includes the rules defined locally. If a rule is defined locally has the same id as one of the rules imported, the rule defined locally has precedence. By leveraging the import mechanism it is thus possible to leveraging existing, curated rules definition, but redefine some rules to adapt to the scanner module specific behaviour.

### Defining a default rule
The scanner module might generate findings with rule id that haven't been included in the rules database. It can be the case for example if the scanner includes a very large number of rules, but it was deemed that only a portion of these were important in the context of the scanner module. When a finding was generated from a rule for which the id doesn't exist in the scanner module rules database, BoostSecurity processes the finding generically, by reporting the finding using the scanner original rule id and attributing the finding to a generic rule group and category. 
It is usually desirable to have a scanner module specific default behaviour for rules that are not included in the scanner module rules database, rather than relying on the generic default behaviour. 
A default rule can be included in the scanner module rules database. The default rule is declared at the bottom of the scanner module's rules database file with the following syntax:
```yaml
default:
  CWE-UNKNOWN:   # rule id that will be reported by default>
    categories:  # the categories for the unknown rule>
    - ALL
    - boost-hardened
    group: top10-insecure-design
    name: CWE-UNKNOWN   <name is the same as rule id>
    pretty_name: CWE-UNKNOWN - Original rule did not map to a known CWE rule
    description: The original rule could not be map to a CWE rule
    ref: https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-rules/  # some reference
```

Note that the default rules can also be redefined locally if there are also default rules imported from other rules databases.


### Redefining rules definition in SARIF

## Taxonomies
Taxonomies are required for proper parsing and processing of results in the Boostsecurity platform. Sarif output without taxonomies will not be parsed by the platform.
